			<h1>Cipher</h1>
			<p>A JavaScript plugin that makes it easier to cipher and decipher your strings.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>Usage</h2>
			<p>To get Cipher, download the file and link to it in your HTML document like so:</p>
			<pre><code>&lt;script type="application/javascript" src="path/to/cipher.js">&lt;/script></code></pre>
			<p>Now you can cipher and decipher basically everything. All functions are accessible via the Cipher object.</p>
			<p>To cipher something using the Atbash cipher, use the following snippet:</p>
			<pre><code>Cipher.to('atbash', 'foo bar');</code></pre>
			<p>To cipher something using the Caesar cipher using a right shift of three, use the following snippet:</p>
			<pre><code>Cipher.to('caesar', 'foo bar', 3)</code></pre>
			<p>Here's the general usage of the Cipher plugin:</p>
			<pre><code>Cipher['to'/'from'](type, string [, key]);</code></pre>
			<p>Note that the key is only needed for the Caesar cipher.</p>
